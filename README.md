## ✨ About Magic Shell

Tired of forgetting complex commands or spending time searching for the right flags? **Magic Shell** is here to change that. By integrating powerful natural language processing directly into your terminal, it allows you to execute commands by simply describing what you want to do. It's an intuitive, beautiful, and "magical" shell designed for developers, system admins, and students alike.

4. Intelligent auto-completion and suggestions powered by command history and AI
5. Preview and confirm potentially dangerous commands (like rm -rf)

### Advanced
1. Context-aware: tracks your current directory, files, and environment
2. Automates multi-step tasks from a single natural language instruction
3. Create custom shortcuts and templates for frequent tasks
4. Interactive mode for clarifying ambiguous commands
5. Integrations with external APIs (e.g., Git, Docker) for extended AI capabilities
6. Cross-platform support: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

2.  **Use the AI Helper**:
    * Prefix your request with `/ai`.
    * Describe the task you want to perform in plain English.
    * The AI will translate it into a shell command, which you can then approve to execute.
3. Use arrow keys and Tab for navigating history and auto-completions.
